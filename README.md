# Gobblet
This project starting in Python (hopefully in C++ later) aims to create a program that will play the game Gobblet well. The game Gobblet is similar to Tic Tac Toe; however, it is played on a 4x4 grid. Like Tic Tac Toe, the aim is to get a row, column, or diagonal of all your pieces. In Gobblet, each player has three stacks of pieces with each stack containing 4 nested sizes of pieces. In Gobblet, a player can cover other pieces with their pieces, assuming the piece that is being covered is smaller. Additionally, it is legal to move pieces once they are already on the board.
